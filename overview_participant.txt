Certainly! The four participant sequences automate data processing between DB2 database and AWS S3, ensuring efficient error handling, validation, and reporting. Participant Sequence 1 retrieves indicative feed data from AWS S3, validates transaction cycle dates against DB2 records, and ensures structured formatting before uploading processed files back to S3. Participant Sequence 2 extracts transaction cycle details from incoming files, processes participant records, and loads data into DB2, maintaining accuracy in transaction logs.

Participant Sequence 3 executes a DB2 stored procedure to process participant data, ensuring smooth execution and tracking results via an uploaded marker file in AWS S3. Participant Sequence 4 focuses on error reporting, extracting participant error logs from DB2, formatting data for structured validation, and uploading a final error report to AWS S3 for auditing purposes.
