Certainly! Below is a detailed step-by-step explanation of each function in the participant_four.txt script.

🔹 Overall Overview
This script automates Participant Sequence 4, focusing on:

Extracting participant error logs from DB2.

Formatting and structuring data for error reporting.

Generating a structured error report file and uploading it to AWS S3.

Handling errors gracefully and logging execution results.

Ensuring database connection closure for safe execution.

🔹 Step-by-Step Breakdown of Each Function
1️⃣ lambda_handler(event, context)
🔸 Purpose: Serves as the main function that orchestrates error report generation and uploads output files.

🔸 Steps Taken:

Logs entry into participant sequence 4 process.

Creates a temporary file (TPODS_PPT_IND_ERR_LOG_41_FILE) for storing extracted data from DB2.

Extracts error records from DB2 using SQL queries:

Fetches header rows (ERR_FILE_HEADER).

Retrieves source records (ERR_FILE_SRC_ROWS).

Extracts trailer rows (ERR_FILE_TRAILER_ROW).

Formats error report content using the tabulate() function:

Structures extracted data properly.

Writes formatted rows into the temporary file.

Calls s3_put_object() to upload the processed error file (TPODS_PPT_IND_ERR_LOG_41.TXT) to AWS S3.

Handles errors using a try-except block, logging all exceptions.

Closes DB2 connection after successful execution.

2️⃣ db2_conn_test()
🔸 Purpose: Establishes a DB2 database connection for querying participant error records.

🔸 Steps Taken:

Uses authentication credentials to connect to DB2.

Returns a DB2 connection object (Conn) for executing queries.

3️⃣ Extracting Error Records from DB2 (pd.read_sql())
🔸 Purpose: Executes SQL queries to fetch different types of error records.

🔸 Steps Taken:

Queries DB2 for header error records (ERR_FILE_HEADER) using pd.read_sql().

Fetches source error rows (ERR_FILE_SRC_ROWS) for validation.

Extracts trailer details (ERR_FILE_TRAILER_ROW) to complete the report.

4️⃣ Formatting Data (tabulate())
🔸 Purpose: Converts DB2-extracted error data into structured text format.

🔸 Steps Taken:

Uses tabulate() to format header, source, and trailer rows.

Converts extracted data into plain text tables.

Writes formatted data into the temporary file (TPODS_PPT_IND_ERR_LOG_41_FILE).

5️⃣ Uploading Error File to AWS S3 (s3_put_object())
🔸 Purpose: Uploads the formatted error log file (TPODS_PPT_IND_ERR_LOG_41.TXT) to AWS S3.

🔸 Steps Taken:

Calls s3_put_object() to retrieve AWS S3 bucket details.

Defines S3 file path:

python
file_key = file_key + "TPODS_PPT_IND_ERR_LOG_41.TXT"
Reads processed error file content (Body=file_str).

Uses s3.put_object() to upload structured error records to AWS S3.

Validates HTTP response code (200) for successful upload.

6️⃣ Error Handling (try-except)
🔸 Purpose: Detects and logs unexpected failures during report generation.

🔸 Steps Taken:

Wraps DB2 execution inside try-except.

If an error occurs:

Logs the exception message.

Captures traceback details using traceback.format_exc().

Calls sys.exit(1) for safe termination.

7️⃣ Closing DB2 Connection (finally block)
🔸 Purpose: Ensures DB2 connection is closed safely after execution.

🔸 Steps Taken:

Calls Conn.close() to prevent connection leaks.

Logs successful connection termination.

8️⃣ Local Execution (if __name__ == "__main__")
🔸 Purpose: Allows the script to be executed locally for testing.

🔸 Steps Taken:

Defines a sample event object for validation.

Calls lambda_handler(event, context).

Logs transaction sequence start and completion.

Wraps execution
