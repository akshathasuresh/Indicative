Certainly! Here’s a step-by-step detailed explanation of each function in the participant_three.txt script.

🔹 Overall Overview
This script automates Participant Sequence 3, focusing on:

Connecting to DB2 and executing a stored procedure for participant data processing.

Handling errors gracefully and logging execution results.

Uploading a transaction marker file (stored_proc.done) to AWS S3 for tracking completion.

Ensuring safe connection closure after execution.

🔹 Step-by-Step Breakdown of Each Function
1️⃣ lambda_handler(event, context)
🔸 Purpose: Acts as the main function that triggers execution of a stored procedure and uploads a completion marker to AWS S3.

🔸 Steps Taken:

Logs entry into Sequence 3 stored procedure execution.

Creates DB2 connection using db2_conn_test().

Creates a cursor object for executing queries.

Calls the stored procedure STGTPODS.P_LOAD_PPT_IND_DATA(41) to process participant data.

Fetches execution results from DB2 (though results are not stored in a file here).

Logs successful completion of the stored procedure.

Handles errors using try-except:

Captures DB2 execution errors.

Logs traceback details.

Calls sys.exit(1) for safe termination if an error occurs.

Closes the cursor and DB2 connection to prevent resource leaks.

Calls s3_seq_done_object() to retrieve AWS S3 bucket details.

Uploads marker file (stored_proc.done) to S3 using s3.put_object().

Logs whether the upload was successful.

2️⃣ db2_conn_test()
🔸 Purpose: Establishes a connection to DB2 database for transaction execution.

🔸 Steps Taken:

Uses authentication credentials to connect to DB2.

Returns a DB2 connection object (Conn) for executing queries.

3️⃣ Calling the Stored Procedure (cur.execute())
🔸 Purpose: Executes the stored procedure STGTPODS.P_LOAD_PPT_IND_DATA for participant data processing.

🔸 Steps Taken:

Creates a DB2 cursor object (cur) to run SQL queries.

Calls:

sql
CALL STGTPODS.P_LOAD_PPT_IND_DATA('41')
Passing the record keeper code (41) as an argument.

Fetches execution results using cur.fetchall() (though results are not stored in this case).

Logs successful completion of transaction processing.

4️⃣ Error Handling (try-except)
🔸 Purpose: Handles unexpected errors during stored procedure execution.

🔸 Steps Taken:

Wraps DB2 execution inside try-except.

If an error occurs:

Logs exception message.

Captures traceback details using traceback.format_exc().

Calls sys.exit(1) for safe termination.

5️⃣ Closing DB2 Connection (finally block)
🔸 Purpose: Ensures DB2 connection and cursor are closed safely after execution.

🔸 Steps Taken:

Closes cursor (cur.close()) to free resources.

Closes DB2 connection (Conn.close()) to prevent leaks.

6️⃣ s3_seq_done_object()
🔸 Purpose: Retrieves AWS S3 bucket details for uploading marker files.

🔸 Steps Taken:

Fetches S3 bucket name, file key, and client object.

Used for storing transaction status files in S3.

7️⃣ Uploading Transaction Marker (stored_proc.done)
🔸 Purpose: Uploads completion marker file to AWS S3 for tracking sequence execution.

🔸 Steps Taken:

Calls s3_seq_done_object() to get S3 bucket details.

Defines upload file path in S3:

python
uploadfile_key = file_key + "stored_proc.done"
Uses s3.put_object() to store an empty marker file in S3.

Checks HTTP response code for success.

8️⃣ Local Execution (if __name__ == "__main__")
🔸 Purpose: Allows the script to be executed locally for testing.

🔸 Steps Taken:

Defines a sample event object with recordkeepercode = 41.

Calls lambda_handler(event, context).

Logs transaction sequence start and completion.

Wraps execution in try-except for error handling and debugging.
