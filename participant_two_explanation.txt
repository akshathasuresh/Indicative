Certainly! Below is a detailed step-by-step explanation of each function in the participant_two.txt script.

🔹 Overall Overview
This script automates Participant Sequence 2, focusing on:

Fetching participant indicative feed data from AWS S3.

Extracting transaction cycle details from incoming files.

Processing records and loading them into DB2.

Handling errors and updating transaction logs.

Uploading processed output files to AWS S3 for tracking.

🔹 Step-by-Step Breakdown of Each Function
1️⃣ lambda_handler(event, context)
🔸 Purpose: Acts as the main function that orchestrates the entire transaction sequence.

🔸 Steps Taken:

Logs the start of Participant Sequence 2.

Fetches indicative file (RCINDICATIVE.DAT) from AWS S3 using s3_outgoing_get_object().

Reads transaction cycle details from the participant feed.

Extracts header (001) details to get record keeper code (RDCKPER_CD) and cycle date (CYC_DT).

Extracts footer (999) details to get the record count (RCD_CNT).

Converts cycle date format from YYYYMMDD to MM-DD-YYYY.

Logs extracted values for verification.

Inserts or updates TPODS.IF_TRANS_CYC table in DB2 based on transaction cycle existence:

If data does not exist, inserts new records.

If data exists, updates transaction counts.

Calls DB2 functions to load participant data into STGTPODS.T_TP41_PART_IND_DATA_ODS.

Uploads completion marker (participant_two.done) to AWS S3 for tracking.

2️⃣ db2_conn_test()
🔸 Purpose: Establishes a connection to the DB2 database for participant transaction processing.

🔸 Steps Taken:

Uses authentication credentials to connect to DB2.

Returns a DB2 connection object for executing SQL queries.

3️⃣ s3_outgoing_get_object()
🔸 Purpose: Retrieves S3 bucket details to access outgoing participant files.

🔸 Steps Taken:

Fetches bucket name, file key, and S3 client object.

Used to read incoming participant files from S3.

4️⃣ Extracting Header Details (001)
🔸 Purpose: Extracts record keeper code (RDCKPER_CD) and transaction cycle date (CYC_DT).

🔸 Steps Taken:

Reads header (001) details from participant feed.

Extracts record keeper code (RDCKPER_CD) from characters 3 to 5.

Extracts cycle date (CYC_DT) from characters 25 onward.

Converts cycle date from YYYYMMDD to MM-DD-YYYY format for DB2 storage.

5️⃣ Extracting Trailer Details (999)
🔸 Purpose: Extracts total record count (RCD_CNT) from participant feed.

🔸 Steps Taken:

Reads footer (999) details from participant feed.

Extracts record count (RCD_CNT) from characters 26 onward.

Adjusts RCD_CNT = Total Count - 2 (excluding header and footer).

Logs extracted values.

6️⃣ Generating LAST_ACTY_DTM Timestamp
🔸 Purpose: Captures current timestamp for the LAST_ACTY_DTM column.

🔸 Steps Taken:

Uses datetime.now() to fetch the current timestamp.

Formats LAST_ACTY_DTM as YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS format.

7️⃣ Inserting or Updating TPODS.IF_TRANS_CYC Table
🔸 Purpose: Stores participant transaction cycle details in DB2.

🔸 Steps Taken:

Checks if a record already exists in TPODS.IF_TRANS_CYC.

If no record exists, inserts transaction details:

RDCKPER_CD, CYC_DT, FILE_TY_CD, RCD_CNT, LAST_ACTY_OPER, LAST_ACTY_DTM.

If record exists, updates transaction count and last activity timestamp.

Commits transaction to DB2 after processing.

8️⃣ Error Handling (try-except)
🔸 Purpose: Handles unexpected errors during transaction execution.

🔸 Steps Taken:

Catches DB2 execution errors.

Logs traceback details for debugging.

Ensures safe termination using sys.exit() with error codes.

9️⃣ Clearing and Loading Participant Data (STGTPODS.T_TP41_PART_IND_DATA_ODS)
🔸 Purpose: Loads participant transaction data into staging tables.

🔸 Steps Taken:

Truncates old records in STGTPODS.T_TP41_PART_IND_DATA_ODS.

Loads new participant data into DB2 staging table.

🔟 Uploading Completion Marker to S3 (participant_two.done)
🔸 Purpose: Uploads completion status file to AWS S3.

🔸 Steps Taken:

Calls s3_seq_done_object() to get S3 bucket details.

Creates marker file (participant_two.done) for completion tracking.

Uploads it to S3 using s3.put_object().

Logs success or failure.

1️⃣1️⃣ Local Execution (if __name__ == "__main__")
🔸 Purpose: Allows script to be executed locally for testing.

🔸 Steps Taken:

Defines a sample event object for validation.

Calls lambda_handler(event, context).

Logs sequence completion status.
